# Project Overview

This project is a hands-on cloud and Linux operations project built to understand
how cost awareness, monitoring, and system-level automation work together in real
AWS environments.

Instead of focusing on building an application, I focused on solving an operational
problem that cloud engineers face regularly: **unexpected cloud costs and lack of
early alerts**.

The project combines:
- AWS native monitoring (CloudWatch, SNS)
- Linux-based automation and checks
- Secure access using IAM roles
- Cost-aware design using Free Tier resources

This project was built step by step, including troubleshooting real networking,
permission, and monitoring issues that commonly occur in production environments.
